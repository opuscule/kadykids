										<h2>Full-time / Part-time Nanny</h2>
										<div class="short-sep"></div>
										<p>As your nanny, I will provide much more than general supervision; I will work alongside you to ensure that the child is happy, healthy, and thriving. The responsibilities of a nanny depend on the needs of the household and the schedule required. My duties may include full care of your child, engaging in creative play, pick-up from school, assisting with homework, meal prep, and light tidying. I will take special care in organizing fun, educational, and age-appropriate activities and outings in order to keep your little one(s) stimulated and content.</p>

										<h2>Nanny Share</h2>
										<div class="short-sep"></div>
										<p>If you’re looking for ways to make childcare more affordable, consider a nanny share! How does it work? A nanny share is when two families share a full-time nanny and split the cost, allowing each family to save on child care expenses while the nanny enjoys a full time salary. Available for ages newborn to school-age, the benefits go beyond finances, providing the socialization of daycare with the one-on-one attention and flexibility of a private nanny. Everyday playmates teach children social skills such as sharing, adaptability, and compromise. </p>

										<h2>Newborn Care Specialist (Baby Nurse)</h2>
										<div class="short-sep"></div>
										<p>A Newborn Care Specialist (NCS) is a highly trained and experienced individual who specializes in infant care. As an NCS, I have extensive knowledge in caring for multiples and premature infants, and am well-versed in establishing good eating and sleeping habits. Whereas nannies work and grow with a family for many years, an NCS is an expert who will work with you for the first weeks and months of your newborn’s life.</p>

										<h2>Postpartum Doula</h2>
										<div class="short-sep"></div>
										<p>If you’re looking for someone to help your family adjust to your new addition, you might want to consider hiring me as a doula. In the first few months after giving birth, many families need a little extra support. Whereas a Newborn Care Specialist focuses on the newborn baby, a doula specializes in caring for the whole family. The early postpartum period is a time full of joy and love, but it can also be a time of chaos and doubt as family members try to find their “new normal.” Having someone around who is trained to mediate any family dynamics that come up and to educate the family on caring for a newborn can be invaluable.</p>
